\subsection{Legal requirements}

\textbf{GDPR}: "An explanation of the decision reached after algorithmic assesment"

\begin{itemize}
    \item Curse of dimensionality: Impossible to collect enough data to represent the problem.
    \item XAI is a young research field. Explantion is not well-defined.
    \item \textbf{Shapley decomposition}: Best way to "poke the box". Characteristic function values: The value of the combinations of the parts.
\end{itemize}
